## Why?

### Why static webpages?

When paired with a good hosting service, static webpages are cheaper to host, easier to maintain, and harder to hack than dynamic ones because there are less moving parts.

### Why one more Ruby static webpage generator?

`BakingRack` is a narrowly-focused library, not an all-encompassing framework.

Jekyll, Middleman, Nanoc, and Bridgetown are frameworks that define how your site is organized. `BakingRack` is only interested in your site being [a Rack app](https://github.com/rack/rack/) (protip: all those frameworks support Rack) in order to gather its static pages and publish them to a static webserver or CDN.

## Getting Started

Start by including `baking_rack` in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'baking_rack'
```

Then run `bundle install`.

## Usage

Ruby API:

```ruby
directory = "site"

# Step 1: build the webpages
BakingRack::Build.run(app: Rails.application, output_directory: directory) do |b|
  b.domain_name = "my-domain.com"

  b.define_static_routes do
    # Render this explicit path using your Rack app.
    get "/about.html"

    # Collect routes from static data
    BlogPost.find_each do |post|
      get post.path
    end

    # Expect statuses other than 200
    get "/404.html", status: 404
  end
end

# Step 2: deploy what was built
BakingRack::AwsS3::Deployer.run(
  directory: directory,
  bucket_name: "my-bucket.com",
)
```

Rake CLI:

```ruby
directory = "site"

# config/initializers/baking_rack.rb
BakingRack::BUILDER = BakingRack::Builder.new(output_directory: directory) do |b|
  # same usage as BakingRack::Build.run above
end

BakingRack::DEPLOYER = BakingRack::Deployers::AwsS3.new(
  directory: directory,
  bucket_name: "my-bucket.com",
)
```

```ruby
# Rakefile
require "baking_rack/rake_task"
BakingRack::RakeTask.new
```

```bash
# compiles the static site into the output directory
$ rake baking_rack:build

# uploads the directory files to the static web hosting service.
$ rake baking_rack:deploy

# perform the build and deploy
$ rake baking_rack:publish

# remove all build files
$ rake baking_rack:clean
```

### Ruby on Rails

`BakingRack` provides some additional help for building static webpages from Ruby on Rails applications, just use its custom builder class:

```ruby
BakingRack::Rails::Build.run(output_directory: directory) do |b|
  b.static_routes do
    # path helpers are exposed here
    get root_path
  end
end
```

Intelligent defaults

* `app` defaults to `Rails.application`
* `domain_name` defaults to `Rails.application.config.hosts.first`

### AWS S3

Add another gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "aws-sdk-s3", require: false
```

Your Access Key and Secret Access Keys are read from your AWS config or ENV.

```ruby
BakingRack::AwsS3::Deployer.new(
  bucket_name: "your-bucket.com", # bucket containing your static files
)
```

If you want terraform to set up your AWS resources required for hosting on S3 and serving via CloudFront, run the following commands:

```ruby
# Ruby API
BakingRack::AwsS3::Terraform.generate(aws_s3_deployer)
```

```bash
# Rake CLI
$ bundle exec rake baking_rack:terraform:aws_s3
```

Then refer to the [Terraform AWS Usage docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started) (hint: `terraform init` `terraform apply`)
